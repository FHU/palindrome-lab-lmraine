Palindrome Lab  
This is an independent lab. Code and solutions must not be shared among classmates. You may ask me questions.

A palindrome is a word with the same letters forward as backwards. 

Examples of palindromes:  
kayak  
Hannah  
racecar

In this lab:
1. Ask the user for input text
2. Complete the function palindrome() to determine if the text is a palindrome.
3. If the text is a palindrome, return True else return False.

Notes
1. An empty string is not a palindrome
2. Case does not matter
3. White spaces should not be taken into consideration
