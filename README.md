# palindrome_lab_template

A palindrome is a word with the same letters forward as backwards. 

Examples of palindromes:
kayak
Hannah
racecar

In this lab:
1. Ask the user for input text
2. Determine if the text is a palindrome.
3. If the text is a palindrome, print "Palindrome" else print "Not a Palindrome"

Notes
1. An empty string is not a palindrome
2. Case does not matter
3. White spaces should not be taken into consideration
